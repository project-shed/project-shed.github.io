This weekend we, Team S.H.E.D. jumped into the Global Gam Jam madness and put together Project S.H.E.D. -- a local multi-player couch game for three players.  We went through a rather informal process but managed to finish a playable build!

This is Team Project S.H.E.D.:

 * Ross - Programming & Art
 * Oddvar - Programming
 * Jeff - Programming
 * Rudi - Programming
 * Patrick - Sound effects
 * Niclas - Music
